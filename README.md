# Home-cosmetic-lab
Welcome to my personal cosmetic formulation lab! 
I’m a hobby formulator working from my home lab, using this repository to organize my projects, experiments, and ingredient research.

## About Me
I’m passionate about DIY cosmetics and continuously researching and learning how to create safe, effective products at home. This repository is my digital notebook—where I keep formulas, experiment results, notes, and helpful resources.
Currently, I got more passionate about human cosmetics formulation that are safe to use around pets, since I have 3 cats. Very hard to find toxicology info though, other than the ussual such as essential oils.

What’s in this Repository?
- **formulas/**: My recipes for shampoo, lotion, and other products.

- **ingredients/**: Information on ingredients, safety, and suppliers.
- **notes/**: My personal lab journal and thoughts.
