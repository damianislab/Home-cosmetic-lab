## Formula info
It's a dry-touch body oil designed for hydration and a lingering scent through the day
Unfortunatelly according to my research (whatever little I could find), has few ingredients that are toxic to cats
The Body oil per se, is wonderfull and I love the feel.

## Where I need help
If anyone can help me reformulate it with less pet toxicity without loosing the dry-feel.

Anyone familiar with toxic levels for cats to provide more info in general for ingredients.
